# Compute Resources

## Login Instance

This is the shell you get into when ssh'ng from outside

- Networked (except ssh to outside)
- 1 core per user
- 5 GB of RAM per user
- 30 min of CPU time per process

## Pre/post processing Instance

Activated with `--partition=prepost`

- Networked
- only 4 nodes
- 2 to 20 hours
- No limitations of the login shell
- I think there 1x 16gb gpu there, but it's there w/o asking

to request:
```
srun --pty --partition=prepost --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=10 --gres=gpu:0 --hint=nomultithread --time=1:00:00 bash --rcfile $six_ALL_CCFRWORK/start-prod
```

## GPU Instances

- No network to outside world
- 160 GB of usable memory. The memory allocation is 4 GB per reserved CPU core if hyperthreading is deactivated (`--hint=nomultithread`). So max per node is `--cpus-per-task=40`


## Quotas

```
idrquota -m # $HOME @ user
idrquota -s # $STORE @ user
idrquota -w # $WORK @ user
idrquota -s -p six # $STORE @ shared
idrquota -w -p six # $WORK @ shared
```
if you prefer it the easy way here is an alias to add to `~/.bashrc`:
```
alias dfi="echo Personal:; idrquota -m; idrquota -s; idrquota -w; echo; echo \"Shared (six):\"; idrquota -w -p six; idrquota -s -p six"
```

## Directories

- `$six_ALL_CCFRSCRATCH` - for checkpoints
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK` - for everything else
- `$six_ALL_CCFRSTORE` - for long term storage in tar files (very few inodes!)

More specifically:

- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/cache_dir` - `CACHE_DIR` points here
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/checkpoints` - symlink to `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/checkpoints` - point slurm scripts here
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/code` - clones of repos we use as source (`transformers`, `megatron-lm`, etc.)
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/conda` - our production conda environment
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/datasets` - cached datasets (normally under `~/.cache/huggingface/datasets`)
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/datasets-custom` - Manually created datasets are here (do not delete these - some take many hours to build):
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/downloads` -  (normally under `~/.cache/huggingface/downloads`)
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/envs` - custom scripts to create easy to use environments
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/models-custom` - manually created or converted models
- `$six_ALL_CCFRWORK/modules` -  (normally under `~/.cache/huggingface/modules`)

Personal:

- `$HOME` - 3GB for small files
- `$WORK` - 5TB / 500k inodes â†’ sources, input/output files
- `$SCRATCH` - fastest (full SSD), no quota, files removed after 30 days without access
- `$STORE` - for long term storage in tar files (very few inodes!)
